IT Modernization Project
Acme Technology Solutions
Project Number 2024-IT-001


BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES

The City of Springfield's permit processing system is outdated and inefficient, causing delays in processing building permits and frustration among citizens and contractors. Current average processing time is 14 business days, and citizen satisfaction scores average 3.2 out of 5.0 based on the 2023 annual survey. The system runs on legacy infrastructure that is difficult to maintain and does not support mobile access.

The Contractor intends to modernize the permit processing system by implementing a cloud-based platform with mobile access, migrating all legacy permit data, and training staff on the new system. This modernization will improve processing times, increase citizen satisfaction, and reduce operational costs.
